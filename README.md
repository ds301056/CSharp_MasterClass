# C# Masterclass

This repository contains my code and notes as I work through a C# masterclass. 
I'm building a strong foundation in C# and object-oriented programming, covering a wide range of topics from basic syntax to advanced concepts.


## Repository Contents

* **Lesson1_Lists:**  Code examples and exercises focusing on working with lists in C#.
* **Lesson2_Arrays:** Code examples and exercises demonstrating the use of arrays in C#.
* **ListsApp:**  A project exploring various list operations, including adding, removing, sorting, and using predicates and lambda expressions.
* **ArrayListC:**  A project demonstrating the use of `ArrayList`, a legacy collection in C#.
* **Hashtables:** A project exploring the use of Hashtables to store key-value pairs.


## Key Concepts Covered

* **Basic Syntax:** Variables, data types, operators, control flow (if-else, loops).
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
* **Data Structures:** Lists, arrays, hashtables, dictionaries.
* **Advanced Concepts:** Delegates, lambda expressions, LINQ, and more.
* **[Add more concepts as you learn them]**

## How to Use This Repository

* **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/ds301056/C-MasterClass.git`
* **Navigate to a specific lesson folder:** `cd Lesson1_Lists` (for example)
* **Open the project in Visual Studio:** Open the `.sln` (solution) file.
* **Run the code:** Press F5 or click the "Start" button to execute the code.
* **Explore the code and comments:**  I've added detailed comments to explain the concepts and logic.
